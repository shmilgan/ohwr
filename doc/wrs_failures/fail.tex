This section tries to identify all the possible ways the White Rabbit Switch can
fail. The structure of each error description is the following:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=0pt]
  \item [] \underline{Status}: describes the implementation status of the WRS
    diagnostics detecting the fault. Can be one of the following:
    \begin{packed_items}
      \item DONE: all the SNMP objects are implemented and the problem is
        reported by a switch
      \item TODO: not all of the SNMP objects are already implemented, the
        problem is either reported only in some situations or not reported at
        all
      \item \emph{for later}: the problem concerns functionality that is not yet
        present in the stable release of the WR switch firmware i.e. it will
        never happen with the current stable firmware release.
    \end{packed_items}
  \item [] \underline{Severity}: describes how critical is the fault. Currently
    we distinguish two severity levels:
    \begin{packed_items}
      \item WARNING - means that despite the fault the synchronization and
        Ethernet switching functionality were not affected so the switch behaves
        correctly in the WR network.
      \item ERROR - means that the fault is critical and most probably a WR
        switch misbehaves in a WR network, possibly causing also problems to
        other WR devices connected to this switch.
    \end{packed_items}
	\item [] \underline{Mode}: for timing failures, it describes which modes are
		affected. Possible values are:
		\begin{packed_items}
			\item \emph{Boundary Clock} - the WR Switch has at least one Slave port
        synchronized to another WR device higher in the timing hierarchy (though
        it may be also Master to other WR/PTP devices lower in the timing
        hierarchy).
			\item \emph{Grand Master} - the WR Switch at the top of the
        synchronization hierarchy. It is synchronized to an external clock (e.g.
        GPS, Cesium) and provides timing to other WR/PTP devices.
			\item \emph{Free-Running Master} - the WR Switch at the top of the
				synchronization hierarchy. It provides timing to other WR/PTP devices
				but runs from a local oscillator (not synchronized to an external
        clock).
      \item \emph{all} - any WR switch can be affected regardless the timing
        mode.
		\end{packed_items}

	\item [] \underline{Description}: What the problem is about, how important it
		is and what are the effects if it occurs.
	\item [] \underline{SNMP objects}: Which SNMP objects should be monitored to
		detect the failure. These may be objects from \texttt{WR-SWITCH-MIB} or one
		of the standard MIBs used by the \emph{net-snmp}.
	\item [] \underline{Notes}: Optional comment for the SNMP implementation. It
    may describe the current implementation of ideas or how to implement it in
    the future.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Timing error}
\label{sec:timing_fail}
As a timing error we define the WR Switch not being able to provide its slave
nodes/switches with correct timing information consistent with the rest of the
WR network.

\noindent This section contains the list of faults leading to a timing error.

\subsubsection{\bf \emph{PTP/PPSi} went out of \texttt{TRACK\_PHASE}}

    \begin{pck_descr}
			\item [] \underline{Status}: DONE
			\item [] \underline{Severity}: ERROR
			\item [] \underline{Mode}: \emph{Boundary Clock}
			\item [] \underline{Description}:\\
				If the \emph{PTP/PPSi} WR servo goes out of the \texttt{TRACK\_PHASE}
				state, this means something bad has happened and the switch lost the
				synchronization to its Master.

\subsubsection{\bf Offset jump not compensated by Slave}
		\label{fail:timing:offset_jump}
		\begin{pck_descr}
			\item [] \underline{Status}: DONE
			\item [] \underline{Severity}: ERROR
			\item [] \underline{Mode}: \emph{Boundary Clock}
			\item [] \underline{Description}:\\
				This may happen if the Master resets its WR time counters (e.g. because
        it lost the link to its Master higher in the hierarchy or to external
				clock), but the WR Slave does not follow the jump.

\subsubsection{\bf Detected jump in the RTT value calculated by \emph{PTP/PPSi}}
		\label{fail:timing:rtt_jump}
		\begin{pck_descr}
			\item [] \underline{Status}: DONE
			\item [] \underline{Severity}: ERROR
			\item [] \underline{Mode}: \emph{Boundary Clock}
			\item [] \underline{Description}:\\
				Once a WR link is established the round-trip delay (RTT) can change
        smoothly due to the temperature variations. However, if a sudden jump is
        detected, that means that an erroneous timestamp was generated either on
        the Master or the Slave side.
				One cause of that could be the wrong value of the t24p transition point.

\subsubsection{\bf Wrong $\Delta_{TXM}$, $\Delta_{RXM}$, $\Delta_{TXS}$,
		$\Delta_{RXS}$ values are reported to the \emph{PTP/PPSi} daemon}
		\label{fail:timing:deltas_report}
		\begin{pck_descr}
			\item [] \underline{Status}: DONE
			\item [] \underline{Severity}: ERROR
			\item [] \underline{Mode}: \emph{all}
			\item [] \underline{Description}:\\
				If \emph{PTP/PPSi} doesn't get the correct values of fixed hardware delays,
				it won't be able to calculate a proper Master-to-Slave delay. Although
				the estimated offset in \emph{PTP/PPSi} is close to 0, the WRS won't be
				synchronized to the Master with the sub-nanosecond accuracy.

\subsubsection{\bf \emph{SoftPLL} became unlocked}
		\label{fail:timing:spll_unlock}
		\begin{pck_descr}
      \item [] \underline{Status}: DONE (to be improved with holdover)
			\item [] \underline{Severity}: ERROR
			\item [] \underline{Mode}: \emph{all}
			\item [] \underline{Description}:\\
				If the \emph{SoftPLL} loses lock, for any reason, Boundary Clock or
        Grand Master switch can no longer be syntonized and phase aligned with
        its time source. WRS in Free-running mode without properly locked Helper
        PLL is not able to perform reliable phase measurements for enhancing Rx
				timestamps resolution. For a Grand Master the reason of \emph{SoftPLL}
				going out of lock might be disconnected 1-PPS/10MHz signals or that the
        external clock is down. In that case, the switch goes into Free-running
        mode and resets the WR time. Later we will have a holdover to keep the
        Grand Master switch disciplined in case it loses external reference.

\subsubsection{\bf \emph{SoftPLL} has crashed/restarted}
		\label{fail:timing:spll_crash}
		\begin{pck_descr}
			\item [] \underline{Status}: TODO \emph{(depends on SoftPLL mem read), (requires changes in lm32 software)}
			\item [] \underline{Severity}: ERROR
			\item [] \underline{Mode}: \emph{all}
			\item [] \underline{Description}:\\
				If the LM32 software crashes or restarts for some reason, its state may
        be either reset or random (if for some reason variables were overwritten
				with junk values). In such case, PLL becomes unlocked and switch is not
				able to provide synchronization to other devices.
			\item [] \underline{SNMP objects}:\\
        {\footnotesize
				\snmpadd{WR-SWITCH-MIB::wrsSpllIrqCnt}\\
        \snmpadd{WR-SWITCH-MIB::wrsStartCntSPLL} }
			\item [] \underline{Note}: We have a similar mechanism as in the
				\emph{wrpc-sw} to detect if the LM32 program has restarted because of
				the CPU following a NULL pointer. However, LM32 program hangs on
				re-initialization phase. 
				In addition to that, we can detect if
				\emph{SoftPLL} is hanging (but not restarted) based on irq counter.

\subsubsection{\bf Link to WR Master is down for slave}
		\label{fail:timing:master_down}
		\begin{pck_descr}
			\item [] \underline{Status}: DONE
			\item [] \underline{Severity}: ERROR (will become WARNING with the
				switch-over)
			\item [] \underline{Mode}: \emph{Boundary Clock}
			\item [] \underline{Description}:\\
				If a Boundary Clock switch loses the link on its Slave port, the timing
        reference is lost. The switch resets counters responsible for keeping
        the WR time, and starts operating in a Free-Running Master mode.
			\item [] \underline{SNMP objects}:\\
        {\footnotesize

\subsubsection{\bf Link to WR Master is up for master}
		\label{fail:timing:master_up}
		\begin{pck_descr}
			\item [] \underline{Status}: DONE
			\item [] \underline{Severity}: ERROR
			\item [] \underline{Mode}: \emph{Grand Master}, \emph{Free-Running Master}
			\item [] \underline{Description}:\\
				In that case there is probably a wrong configuration. Neither the
				\emph{Grand Master} nor the \emph{Free-Running Master} should be
				connected to another WR Master.
			\item [] \underline{SNMP objects}:\\

\subsubsection{\bf PTP frames don't reach ARM}
		\label{fail:timing:no_frames}
		\begin{pck_descr}
			\item [] \underline{Status}: DONE
			\item [] \underline{Severity}: ERROR
			\item [] \underline{Mode}: \emph{all}
			\item [] \underline{Description}:\\
				In this case, \emph{PTP/PPSi} will fail to stay synchronized and provide
				synchronization. Even if the WR servo is in the \texttt{TRACK\_PHASE}
        state, it calculates a new phase shift based on the Master-to-Slave delay
				variations. To calculate these variations, it still needs timestamped
				PTP frames flowing. There could be several causes of such fault:
				\begin{itemize}
					\item HDL problem (e.g. SwCore or Endpoint hanging)
					\item \emph{wr\_nic.ko} driver crash
					\item wrong VLANs configuration
				\end{itemize}

				\snmpadd{WR-SWITCH-MIB::wrsTimingStatus}\\
        \snmpadd{WR-SWITCH-MIB::wrsMainSystemStatus} }
			\item [] \underline{Note}: If the kernel driver crashes, there is not much
				we can do. We end up with either our system frozen or a reboot. For
				wrong VLAN configuration and HDL problems we can monitor if PTP frames
				are flowing on Slave port(s) of WRS and raise an alarm (change status
				word) if they don't flow anymore. We should combine this with the link
				status (up/down). If VLANs are mis configured, we don't receive PTP
				frames, but the link is still up. This could let us distinguish from a
				lack of frames due to the link down (which is a separate issue).

\subsubsection{\bf Detected SFP not supported for WR timing}
		\label{fail:timing:wrong_sfp}
		\begin{pck_descr}
			\item [] \underline{Status}: DONE
			\item [] \underline{Severity}: ERROR
			\item [] \underline{Mode}: \emph{all}
			\item [] \underline{Description}:\\
				By not supported SFP for WR timing we mean a transceiver that doesn't
				have the \emph{alpha} parameter and fixed hardware delays defined in the
				SFP database (\texttt{CONFIG\_SFPXX\_PARAMS} parameters in dot-config). The consequence is
				\emph{PTP/PPSi} not having the right values to estimate link asymmetry.
				Despite \emph{PTP/PPSi} offset being close to 0 \emph{ps}, the device won't
				be properly synchronized.

        \snmpadd{WR-SWITCH-MIB::wrsMainSystemStatus} }
			\item [] \underline{Note}: WRS configuration allow to disable this check on some ports.
				That is because ports may be used for regular (non-WR) PTP
				synchronization or for data transfer only (no timing). In that case any
				Gigabit SFP can be used (also copper). Detecting if a non-Gigabit
				Ethernet SFP is plugged into the cage is covered in issue
        \ref{fail:other:sfp}.

				capabilities. Then \texttt{Monit} restarts the missing process.
				The number of process starts is stored in a corresponding object.

				If \emph{HAL} crashes, \emph{PTP/PPSi} is not able to communicate with

		\label{fail:timing:wrong_config}
		\begin{pck_descr}
			\item [] \underline{Status}: TODO
			\item [] \underline{Severity}: WARNING
			\item [] \underline{Mode}: \emph{all}
			\item [] \underline{Description}:\\
				If there is a wrong configuration applied to the \emph{PTP/PPSi} or HAL
				(i.e.  wrong fixed delays, mode of operation etc.) there is not much we
				can do. The responsibility of WR experts (or person deploying the
				system) is to make sure that all the devices have a correct
				configuration. Later we can only generate warnings, if the key
				configuration options are changed remotely (e.g. Grand Master mode to
				Free-running Master or updated fixed hardware delays values).\\
				For misconfigured VLANs, we can monitor if PTP frames are flowing on
				Slave port(s) of the switch.
			\item [] \underline{SNMP objects}: \emph{(not yet implemented)}
			\item [] \underline{Note}: When a new configuration file is fetched on
        boot time, compare it with a previously used config (the whole file,
        but especially timing-critical fields like PTP/WR mode, fixed hardware
        delays). Report using the Syslog (\emph{info}/\emph{warning}) if the
        configuration has changed.
    \end{pck_descr}

\subsubsection{\bf Switchover failed}
		\begin{pck_descr}
			\item [] \underline{Status}: for later
			\item [] \underline{Severity}: ERROR
			\item [] \underline{Mode}: \emph{Boundary Clock}, \emph{Grand Master}
			\item [] \underline{Description}: \emph{(not yet implemented)}\\
				In case the primary timing link breaks, switchover is responsible for
				seamless switching to the backup one to keep the device in sync. If WRS
				operates in a \emph{Boundary Clock} mode, switchover is about switching
				between two (or more) WR links to one or multiple WR Masters. If it
				operates in a \emph{Grand Master} mode, it is about broken/lost
				connection to an external reference and switching to a backup WR link
				(another WR Master). Regardless of the configuration, if we fail to
				switch-over to a backup link (e.g. because it is down), WRS resets
				the time counters and continue the operation as a Free-Running Master.
			\item [] \underline{SNMP objects}: \emph{(not yet implemented)}
			\item [] \underline{Note}: we should probably use parameters reported by
				the backup channel(s) of the SoftPLL and the backup PTP servo to be able
				to detect and report that something went wrong.
		\end{pck_descr}

\subsubsection{\bf Holdover for too long}
		\begin{pck_descr}
			\item [] \underline{Status}: for later
			\item [] \underline{Severity}: WARNING
			\item [] \underline{Mode}: \emph{Grand Master}
			\item [] \underline{Description}: \emph{(not yet implemented)}\\
				Signaling active holdover is one thing, but if a Grand Master switch is
				kept in holdover for too long, it may drift away from the ideal external
				reference too much. All devices in a WR network will be still
				synchronized, but no longer in sync with the external reference.
			\item [] \underline{SNMP objects}: \emph{(not yet implemented)}

\subsection{Data error}
When the WR switch is not able to forward Ethernet traffic between devices
connected to the ports, we consider this a data error. This section contains the
list of faults leading to a data error.

				This obviously stops the flow of frames on an Ethernet port and there is
				not much we can do besides reporting an error. Topology redundancy is a
				cure for that (if a backup link is fine, and reconfiguration does not
				fail). There might be several causes of a link down:
				\begin{itemize}
					\item unplugged fiber
					\item broken fiber
					\item broken SFP
					\item wrong (non-complementary) pair of WDM SPFs used
				\end{itemize}
				However, we are not able to distinguish between them inside the switch.

			\item [] \underline{Severity}: ERROR
			\item [] \underline{Description}:\\
				If the SwCore is hanging, then the Ethernet forwarding is not
				performed on one or multiple ports. We have a HDL watchdog module which
				constantly monitors if the SwCore is not stuck. If such a situation is

				important processes (warning should be reported if they crash). If any
				of the processes has crashed, we need to restart it and increment a
				per-process counter reported through the SNMP. Dot-config should also
        let us define which processes are not that important and the switch
        should not restart even if such a process fails to start (e.g.
        \emph{lighttpd}).

				Crucial processes (Error report if any of them crashes):
				\begin{itemize}
					\item \emph{PTP/PPSi}
					\item \emph{wrsw\_rtud} -- after adding configuration preserving code
						on restart, RTUd could be crossed out from this list
					\item \emph{wrsw\_hal}
				\end{itemize}
				Less critical processes (Restarting them and Warning generation is
				enough):
				\begin{itemize}
					\item \emph{dropbear}
					\item \emph{udhcpc}
					\item \emph{rsyslogd}
					\item \emph{snmpd}
					\item \emph{lighttpd}
					\item \emph{TRUd/eRSTPd} -- not yet implemented
				\end{itemize}

				\emph{wrsw\_rtud} -- we need to set the flag informing the process has
				crashed so that when it runs again it knows that HDL is already
				configured. It should not erase static entries in the RTU table (e.g.
				multicasts for PTP), the static entries set by-hand as well as VLANs.
				Dynamic entries are not a problem. RTUd can learn all MACs after
				restarting. The only consequence will be increased network traffic due
				to frames broadcast until all the MACs are learned. In general,
				the source code has to be checked to make sure what is cleared on the
				startup and modified to preserve the configuration.\\

				\emph{TRUd/eRSTPd} -- topology reconfiguration is done in hardware if
				needed, the daemon is used only to configure the TRU/RTU HDL module.
				However, the story is similar as with the RTUd. If eRSTPd crashes, we
				need to store this information so that when it runs again, it does not
				erase the whole configuration. Also if a topology reconfiguration
				happens while eRSTPd is down, HDL should keep the flag for the eRSTPd so
				that it's aware the backup link is active.

\subsection{Undetectable errors}

Beside the various errors already listed in previous sections, there are some
situations when reporting a problem to the SNMP manager or Syslog server is not
possible. This section lists some of them and proposes alternative ways of
diagnostics.

\subsubsection{\bf File system / Memory corruption}
		\label{fail:other:memory}
		\begin{pck_descr}
			\item [] \underline{Description}:\\
        Memory or file system corruption can produce unpredictable results. It
        may cause a failure of any of the processes running on the switch.

		\end{pck_descr}

\subsubsection{\bf Kernel freeze}
		\begin{pck_descr}
			\item [] \underline{Description}:\\
				If the Linux kernel freezes there is nothing that can be done. It can
        freeze e.g. due to some infinite loop in the irq handler. It is similar
        to the power failure, somebody has to go to the place where the WRS is
        installed and investigate/restart the device.
			\item [] \underline{SNMP objects}: \emph{(none)}
			\item [] \underline{Note}:
				If we have watchdog in our CPU it should be used.
		\end{pck_descr}

\subsubsection{\bf Power failure}
		\begin{pck_descr}
			\item [] \underline{Description}:\\
				Power failure may be either a WRS problem (i.e. broken power supply
				inside the switch) or an external voltage problem. It's up to the
        Network Management Station to raise an alarm if the SNMP Agent does
				not respond to the SNMP requests.
			\item [] \underline{SNMP objects}: \emph{(none)}
		\end{pck_descr}

\subsubsection{\bf Hardware problem}
		\begin{pck_descr}
			\item [] \underline{Description}:\\
				If any crucial hardware part breaks, it will be most probably noticed
        as one (or multiple) timing / data errors described in the previous
        sections. Besides that, there is no self-diagnostics built-in on the
        switch hardware boards. A few examples of hardware failures and problems
        it may cause:
				\begin{itemize}
          \item DAC / VCO -- problems with synchronization (failures in
            \ref{sec:timing_fail})
					\item cooling fans -- rise of the temperature inside the WRS box
						(failure \ref{fail:other:temp})
					\item power supply, ARM, FPGA -- booting problem (failure

				management link is down. This should be detected and reported by the NMS
				if it does not receive SNMP and ICMP responses from the WRS.
			\item [] \underline{SNMP objects}: \emph{(none)}
		\end{pck_descr}

\subsubsection{\bf No static IP on the management port \& failed to DHCP}
		\begin{pck_descr}
			\item [] \underline{Description}:\\
				From the operator's point of view it is similar to the issue
				\ref{fail:other:management_link}. WRS is not accessible through the
				management port, so its status cannot be reported. This should be
				detected and reported by the NMS if it does not receive SNMP and ICMP
				responses from the WRS. In such case the configuration of the switch and
