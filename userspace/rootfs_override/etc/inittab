# Format for each entry: <id>:<runlevels>:<action>:<process>
#
# id        == tty to run on, or empty for /dev/console
# runlevels == ignored
# action    == one of sysinit, respawn, askfirst, wait, and once
# process   == program to run

# Startup the system
::sysinit:/bin/mount -t proc proc /proc
#::sysinit:/bin/mount -o remount,rw / # REMOUNT_ROOTFS_RW

# He re had several "mount" as sysinit actions; coalesce in one command only

::sysinit:/etc/init.d/wrs-boot-procedure

# now run any rc scripts
::sysinit:/etc/init.d/rcS
# We want to keep the monitoring running even when it crashes. So, it
# must run within initab with respawn action
::respawn:/etc/init.d/monit.sh init

# Put a getty on the serial port
ttyGS0::respawn:/bin/ash --login
ttyS0::respawn:/bin/ash --login

# Stuff to do before rebooting
# run all /etc/rcS/K??* scripts
::shutdown:/etc/init.d/rcK
null::shutdown:/bin/umount -a -r
